I worked at an IT Tech Consulting Company in the summer of 2020 as an intern. I helped the company with numerous things. I reviewed excel sheets, watched online seminars from potential clients, and helped with sorting out files. The consulting company I worked at worked with huge companies, so I had time to sign a Non Disclosure Agreement. It was important to keep company secrets. However, through this experience I learned that it is hard to do an internship in a company that has nothing to do with your major. I decided to work at this company to gain experience in different fields, because there is a business aspect to technology. 
<br><br>

        Iâ€™ve worked as an intern at a non profit organization called FACE LA. It was an organization that helped people learn about foreclosure homes and saving their homes from being taken away from a bank. I made sure to follow up on people who signed up for the classes and helped non English speaking workers in the office when English speaking students called the office. I also had to prepare all the pamphlets for the classes and helped the organization with their annual fair. I contacted various Congressmen and important officials to attend or speak at the event. It was difficult to contact the right people for the right people, especially because the information that the organization had was outdated. It took time for me to find all the updated information, and add every single one to the database. I also helped to interview people for potential jobs. One of the jobs Iâ€™ve always been interested in has been HR, so it was nice to gain experience in that area. It was fun to interview people, and talk to different types of people in a professional setting. 
<br><br>

        I was the social media director of an instagram page called the Myriad News. Itâ€™s an online news blog that talks about current events around the world. At first it was hard to manage the instagram, but as time went on it became easier. I had to make sure I continuously watched the follower and following numbers. I made sure to look at the people the profile is following, and to see if those people are related to the content we were putting out. If the profiles we were following were unrelated to our content, I made sure to unfollow all of them. I also had to look out for profiles that were related to our content. It was important to unfollow people who had unfollowed us and follow people back. Every week, I made sure to find the potential profiles we would follow, and message them to follow us back. I would also constantly check our messages and post stories for other accounts. It took time to post and come up with good captions for each article on the instagram. It was hard to keep track of all the people following and unfollowing as the instagram grew bigger and bigger.
